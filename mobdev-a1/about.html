                <h2>My Dog</h2>
                <p>This is my labradoodle Bingo. We got her in the fall of 2020. She's very smart yet very silly. For example, we have trained her to open and close doors, but her favorite activity is bitting rocks.</p>

                    <p>One of my favorite memories with Bingo is when she was a puppy and I was cleaning the pool. As I walked around the pool, Bingo kept following me around and trying to look into the net I was using to scoop out the leaves. When I would dump out the leaves from the next, Bingo would stand underneath and do a little dance and wag her tail. When the leaves would fall out, she would jump and try to catch them.</p>

                    <h4>Her Tricks</h4>
                    <p>Bingo is a very smart dog despite her desire to eat rocks. Even though she is only 9 months old as of writing this she knows many tricks.</p>
